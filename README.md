# 🚀 LaraBaseX

A Laravel 12 + ReactJS Full Stack Starter Boilerplate.  
This is a secure, modular, production-ready base project using Laravel 12 with ReactJS frontend, ideal for building scalable web applications without Blade.



## 📁 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel 12 (REST API)
- **Frontend**: ReactJS (Vite + Axios)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum
- **Deployment Ready**: Docker / Shared Hosting / VPS



### 🔒 1. Security Essentials
These features protect your app, data, and server from attacks:

-  HTTPS enforced (Force HTTPS in AppServiceProvider)
-  CORS configured properly (config/cors.php)
-  CSRF protection (even for APIs, use Sanctum or tokens)
-  Rate Limiting for APIs (ThrottleRequests middleware)
-  Validation layer using FormRequest (php artisan make:request)
-  Use policies/gates for authorization (php artisan make:policy)
-  Avoid mass assignment bugs ($fillable vs $guarded)
-  Escape output or sanitize input if user-generated data is stored
-  Sanitize uploaded files & validate MIME types
-  Use environment variables for all secrets (never hardcode keys)
-  Disable debug mode on production (APP_DEBUG=false)
-  Log all authentication attempts and system errors
-  Do not expose Laravel version in headers

 
### 🧱 2. Architecture & Structure Essentials
-  Use Service classes for business logic (e.g. App\Services\UserService)
-  Use Repository pattern (clean separation from Eloquent queries)
-  Keep controllers thin, use Services for logic
-  Helpers.php for reusable functions (as you're doing)
-  Use enums for static statuses or types (php artisan make:enum)
-  Event-Listener system for side-effects (e.g. sending email after registration)
-  Job Queues setup (Redis + Supervisor in production)
-  Use resource() routes & API standards (api.php)
-  Transform API response data using Laravel Resource classes

 
### 📦 3. Packages to Include
-  Spatie Laravel Permission – roles/permissions
-  Laravel Sanctum or Passport – token-based auth
-  Laravel Telescope (local/dev) – debugging, request log
-  Laravel Debugbar (local/dev) – performance analysis
-  Spatie Backup – scheduled database/file backups
-  Spatie Activity Log – audit logs for user actions

 
### 🧠 4. Developer Experience (DX)
-  API Documentation via Swagger or Postman
-  Postman Collection for APIs preloaded
-  PHPStan or Larastan for static analysis
-  Predefined Error messages in lang/en/messages.php
-  Global Exception Handler for API errors
-  Standard API Response format using success(), error() helpers
-  Custom Artisan commands (php artisan make:command)
-  Seeder & Factory files for test data
-  Well-structured .env.example file

 
### 🧰 5. Frontend Integration (ReactJS)
Since Laravel 12 uses Vite + React:

-  Serve React app via Vite from Laravel backend
-  Set up proxy in vite.config.js to API routes
-  React routing via React Router DOM
-  Token-based authentication (e.g. Sanctum)
-  Store tokens securely (httpOnly if possible)
-  Axios with global error interceptor
-  Dotenv file in React for API URLs

 
### 🔐 6. User Management Essentials
-  Register/Login/Logout APIs
-  Change Password / Forgot Password / Email Verify
-  User roles and permissions (admin, user, manager)
-  Login attempt throttling
-  User profile with avatar upload
-  Two-Factor Authentication (optional)

 
### 🛠️ 7. Helper Functions You Should Add
You already have many! Add:

-  api_success() / api_error() – standardized response
-  generate_slug() – auto slug from title
-  upload_file() – universal file uploader
-  remove_file() – delete uploaded file
-  get_file_url() – retrieve full file URL from path
-  get_random_code() – for OTP, referral codes
-  human_readable_time() – time ago format
-  log_activity() – wrapper to log user actions

 
### 💾 8. MySQL Best Practices
-  Use InnoDB, not MyISAM
-  Use foreign keys with onDelete('cascade')
-  Add indexes to frequently searched fields
-  Store timestamps in UTC, convert in app
-  Avoid text or json unless needed
-  Use migrations and version your DB

 
### 🔄 9. Deployment & Production Readiness
-  .env file set up with production keys
-  Use queues and Supervisor (for jobs)
-  Enable caching (config, route, view, queries)
-  Enable Redis or Memcached
-  DB backups automated
-  Health check route (/health)
-  Use Laravel Forge or Ploi or GitHub Actions for CI/CD
